## Running the tests

#### Unit Tests

- From the **root** folder, run this command: `yarn test` or `npm test`

#### E2E Tests

- We decided to use the [**walnutjs**](https://github.com/mmendesas/walnutjs) framework to write the end-to-end tests, the following steps will help you run those tests:

1. Using the web interactions (easily to see what happens during execution)
   - Before execution, you need to intall `protractor` and start `webdriver-manager`:
   ```sh
    npm install -g protractor
    webdriver-manager update
    webdriver-manager start
   ```
   - Run the tests
   ```sh
     yarn run test:e2e
   ```
2. It's possible to run this using a **dockerized** structure:
   - See [this docs](https://github.com/andresakai/docker-protractor) to see more details
